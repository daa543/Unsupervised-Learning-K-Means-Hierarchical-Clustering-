# Unsupervised-Learning-K-Means-Hierarchical-Clustering-

I used unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, using the Wine Clustering dataset. This dataset, which contains chemical properties of different wine samples, allowed me to explore patterns and group the data without predefined labels.

I applied K-Means clustering to partition the dataset into distinct clusters based on the similarities in the features, enabling the identification of underlying patterns. Additionally, I performed hierarchical clustering, which provided a dendrogram to visualize the clustering process and understand the hierarchical relationships between the data points.

These clustering methods offered valuable insights into the structure of the dataset, showcasing how unsupervised learning can be leveraged to discover hidden patterns and groupings in data.
